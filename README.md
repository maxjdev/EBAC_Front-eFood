## Description

Italian food e-commerce using React, Redux and TypeScript. Each part of the project was componentized into an organized structure. The application dynamically consumes data from an API using fetch, ensuring an up-to-date experience.
Styling was done with styled-components, and responsiveness is ensured with HTML and CSS. To keep the code clean, I used ESLint and Prettier. Explore this project that integrates modern technologies to create an efficient and responsive online shopping platform.
